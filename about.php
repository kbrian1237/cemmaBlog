        <h2>What Cemma Stands For</h2>
        <p><strong>Cemma</strong> isn't just another blog — it's a platform built for clarity, expression, and thoughtful conversation.</p>

        <p>The name comes from <em>“sema”</em>, a Swahili word meaning “to say.” That root idea — open, honest expression — drives everything from the design to the dynamic comment system behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>This blog was created with a focus on simplicity in structure and power in functionality. Whether you're here to read, reflect, or respond, we believe in letting content speak for itself — free from distractions and full of intention.</p>

        <p>Every feature, from live comment updates to responsive navigation, was built with one question in mind: “Does this help the conversation flow?”</p>

        <p>If you're passionate about sharing what matters — welcome. This is where your words find a home.</p>
